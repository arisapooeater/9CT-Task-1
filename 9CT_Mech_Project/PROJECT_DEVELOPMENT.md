# 9CT Assessment Task 1
### By Arisa Komatsu

## Requirements Outline
I need to design a program for the EV3 MINDSTORMS robot to allow it to identify and collect the yellow and red blocks back to the start zone using the colour sensor whilst navigating past other blocks using the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and adjust its path automatically.
#### Key Actions
1. Move forward until an obstacle is detected.
3. Move back and turn 90° from obstacle if the obstacle is green or blue.
4. Continue moving forward if an obstacle is red or yellow, then turn 180°.

### Functional Requirements (of key actions)
1. Obstacle Detection - The robot must stop moving when the ultrasonic sensory detects an obstacle within 10cm.

Scenario: The robot is navigating a path and encounters an obstacle.

Inputs: The ultrasonic sensor detects an object within 10 cm.

Action: The robot moves forward until an obstacle is detected.

Expected Outcome: The robot stops moving.

2. Green/Blue Obstacle Detection - The robot must turn 90°, move forward 10cm, then turn back to original pathway and continue moving forward when the colour sensor detects that an obstacle is green or blue.

Scenario: The robot is navigating a path and encounters an obstacle.

Inputs: The ultrasonic sensor detects an object within 10 cm.

Action: The robot moves forward until an obstacle is detected.

Expected Outcome: The robot stops moving.

3. Red/Yellow Obstacle Detection

| Test Case | Input     | Expected Output   |
|---------- |---------- |----------------   |
|           |n/a           |                   |
|           |           |                   |
|           |           |                   |

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Efficiency - The robot should be able to complete the task within 2-3 minutes.

- Response Time - The robot should respond to sensor input(for both ultrasonic and colour sensor) within 1 second.

- Accuracy - The red and yellow blocks should be transported back to the start area  with all or most of its area within the box.
